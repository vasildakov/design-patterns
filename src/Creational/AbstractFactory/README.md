# Abstract Factory Pattern

The abstract factory design pattern is one of the 23 patterns described in the 1994 Design Patterns book. 

The Design Patterns book describes the abstract factory pattern as "an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes."

The pattern describes how to solve such problems:

- Encapsulate object creation in a separate (factory) object by defining and implementing an interface for creating objects.
- Delegate object creation to a factory object instead of creating objects directly.
